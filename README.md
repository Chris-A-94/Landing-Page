This is the second project of the Odin Project course.

It comes at the end of learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and Flex. It's about creating a standard landing page.

Something that I aparently got wrong is the font. I found and imported Roboto correctly, but the google fonts webpage makes you choose which weights you're going to use and I was unable to recognize all. As a result, I was limited on the font-weight commands that actually worked.
